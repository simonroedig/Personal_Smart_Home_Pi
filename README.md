# 🏠 Personal Smart Home Pi

My Raspberry Pi 🍓 runs (currently):
- **Pi-hole:** for ad-blocking
- **Pi Camera:** for simple surveillance

Dashboard Components:
- **Frontend:** Modern Next.js dashboard with personal log-in
- **Backend:** Server and App hosted on Vercel ▲
- **DB:** Firebase 🔥 for state persistence and Google Drive API for security camera content

Remotely toggle & monitor the Pi from anywhere. Simple, personal, mine.

**Authentication in place!** Only I (or my Pi) can control it.

Repo will grow 🔜
