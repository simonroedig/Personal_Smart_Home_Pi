# 🏠 Personal Smart Home Pi

My Raspberry Pi 🍓 runs (currently):
- **Pi-hole** for ad-blocking
- **Pi Camera** for simple surveillance

- **Frontend** Modern Next.js dashboard
- **Backend** Server and App hosted on Vercel ▲
- **DB** Firebase 🔥 for state persistence and Google Drive API for security camera content

Remotely toggle & monitor the Pi from anywhere. Simple, personal, mine.

Repo will grow 🔜
